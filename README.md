# Taxi-optimization-for-redmerble.ai

## Project description: 

You are an event planner for a small Melbourne consulting firm. Your organization is holding an event in the Gold Coast which requires everyone to fly from Melbourneâ€™s Tullamarine airport at Departure Dr, Melbourne Airport, VIC 3045. Your company has decided to organize taxis for its employees, but wants to minimize the total cost paid (ie total distance travelled while carrying at least one passenger) by having employees share taxis where possible.!


## Assumptions:
- All the addresses that are given are valid. No missing or wrong values
- There are outliers but we are keeping them since all the values are necessary for us to work with
- The employees are good friends with each other, they are comfortable with sharing one taxi
- There is a trade off between time of arriving and cost of the taxi

## Data pre-processing:
- No need to do much data cleaning, since we assumed the data provided are valid. However, we do need to understand the data that is given.
- I get the latitude and longitude of each address for further opporation, put them in the data frame as new attributes

## Approach to this problem:
- I put as many people as we can into one taxi(which is 4) to save the money on calling extra taxis.
- There are 75 employees. We call 19 cabs for them. 18 of them have 4 people in it, 1 one them has only 3 people
- In order to make sure that the time of picking up wont take too long, so I chose 4 closest people to get into one taxi (using k-means) 
- In each cluster, we pick up the one has got longest distance from the airport first, then go to the second, second last then the last. (it's pretty naive). we can use google map api later on to improve it).
- or we can let employees go to the pick up location by themselves, and the pick up location can be the centre of the cluster (this way can save so much time pick up time and also cost of taxis),it's just an option.
- Calculate the fee of each employee have their own taxi and the fee of a taxi takes 4 employees, also the difference between them.

## future steps:
- look deeper into trade off between cost and time
- use google map api to check the duration between each address and airport
- try different ks for K-mean, we can use elbow method to find K
- expand the project further for larger data sets 

## Output maps && plots
### Separate all the employees into 19 taxis by using k-means, each group are presented in different colors. There is a center point which I used car icon
